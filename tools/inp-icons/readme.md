# INP-ICONS 
The inp-icons folder houses all icons and logo's that are used for publication of the Software within the Package.

Examples are:
- Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune)
- InWorkspace (Workspace365)
- Ivanti Workspace Control

#### Naming convention
For the icons and logo's use the following naming convention:
```
"PackageName"-"width"x"height".extension
```
As an example for the package inp-central-7zip this could be:
```
inp-central-7zip-76x76.png
```

#### Multiple Entry Points

When a single package contains multiple program's/entry points that use their own shortcut a slightly different naming convention is used.
We use the exact package name and add the individual application names as a suffix.

As an Example for Office ProPlus this would be:

```
inp-central-office-365-proplus-nl-word-76x76.png
inp-central-office-365-proplus-nl-excel-76x76.png
inp-central-office-365-proplus-nl-powerpoint-76x76.png
```

#### Transparency
Determine where you want to use your logo and then choose if it should be solid or transparent.
Solid logo's are perfectly fine within for example Intune, but transperent logo's give a much cleaner look within InWorkspace.
If you want your logo to be transparent and you can only find solid logo's on the internet, consider using the following website to convert them to transparent:

This website is also helpfull when the original logo size is to big for your application (InWorkspace for instance), and you need to size it down without losing to much image quality.
