    <!--InPackage uses tags to identify special package types
    This information is used for troubleshooting and billing
    At the moment three InPackage Tags are available.
    Add these tags when your package falls in those catagories:
    
    Shortcut
    Add this tag when your package is only used to create shortcuts instead of installing software.
    This scenario is mainly used when the software resides on the network and InPackage is used to fill the StartMenu.
    Shortcut Packages are less complex as full blown packages, this Tag enables us to ajust the pricing accordingly.

    Settings
    Add this tag when your package is only used to configure Settings instead of installing software.
    In this scenario the actual software installation is handled by a Package that is configured as a Depency of the Settings Package.
    This scenario is mainly used when the software installation Package resides on the Central share and therefor Customer specific Settings are not allowed within the Installation Package.
    Settings Packages are always placed in the Customer repo and follow a strict naming convention as Described in the InPackage Documentation.
    The Settings Tag enables us to ajust the pricing accordingly.

    FreeOfCharge
    This tag enables us to identify packages that should not be part of the Billing process.
    This Tag is mainly used for packages that are part of the InPackage infrastructe.
    Examples are the insignit-helper updater service and reporting packages.

    note: A package has only one InPackage type. Therfor only use one of these types in your Tags list.
          If none of these Types are defined the package is marked as "Full", and therefor Billed als a Full blown package.
